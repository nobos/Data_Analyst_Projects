4. Within the framework of the project, a list of hypotheses was analyzed to increase the revenue of the online store using ICE and ICE methods. An A\B test was evaluated to select one of the solutions: 1. Stop the test, fix the victory of one of the groups; 2. Stop the test, fix the absence of differences between the groups; 3. Continue the test.
